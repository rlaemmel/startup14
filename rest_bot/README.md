A client using the API of the Django-based Polls app at https://github.com/rlaemmel/mysite

There are these scripts for accessing the API:
* index.py: list all polls
* detail.py: list details for a given poll
* vote.py: vote on a given choice of a given poll
* bot.py: continuously vote to maintain a given choice of a given poll as the most popular one

This example is used in a software development lecture to explain basics of REST.
